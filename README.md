# Organizing Map Folders
Custom maps should be kept in a sub-directory of your EverQuest map directory. For example,

C:\users\public\Everquest\maps\Brewall's Maps  
C:\users\public\Everquest\maps\Good's Maps  

In-game, you switch between map folders via a dropdown in the top left corner of the map.

## Brewall's Maps
Brewall's maps are posted on their  site, http://www.eqmaps.info  
To get an idea of the care Brewall puts into mapping, look at the Map Comparisons here:
